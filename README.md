# Lissajous

This is a simple lissajous graph drawing app made with p5.js library and plain HTML.

To launch it, simply drop the file 'index.html' to the browser window.
***
User can utilize four sliders for configuring parameters for [Lissajous functions](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LissajousCurve.html), with default values at program start for each of them.

The graph is automatically drawn with "self-cleaning" when the tail of the drawn graph gets too long - the drawn graph cannot be longer than 500 points on canvas.

Thanks to that, user can change the values of the Lissajous functions without the need for cleaning the canvas each time.
